Evos studio is a web based drone synth/visualizer built with <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/">Tone.js</a> &amp; <a href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js</a>

The project is based around four sine wave oscillators with controls for the amplitude and frequency of each wave. The oscillators are mixed together and sent through a limiter to the audio output. 
The visuals are based on the same four sine waves being sent as uniforms into a glsl shader which is using vector displacement to visualized the waveforms in realtime.
